# Our vision

We are working aside human right defenders to build a tool that can capture reliable and authentic proofs of human rights violations and strengthen plausible denial to help activists in transitional justice. 

# Why we need contribution

Our tool is designed to help a broad community. Therefore, we need the contribution of everybody to make it stronger. Either if you are a potential user, a coder, a crypto enthusiast, a lawyer, a journalist, a citizen, or just someone that felt curious about the project, your help will be important for us. 

We are an open organization committed with the defense of human rights and free speech in Latin America. If you want to know more about us, read the README file or visit us in our webpage www.asuntosdelsur.org.

## How to report bugs

Ask your contributors to stay on the lookout for can any potential issue that might cause problems for the project. These could be problems in code (if you’re creating software), content omissions or copy errors (if you’re creating a learning resource), or any issues with the functionality or design of your project. 

Most projects invite all contributors to report bugs, so "debugging" or fixing problems happens quickly and with the input of the community. Take a look at [Atom's example](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#reporting-bugs) for how to teach people to report bugs to your project.
